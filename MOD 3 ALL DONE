# FIRST PROB
#Comparison with Mutable Sequences
my_list = [1,2,3]
my_list[0] = "a"

 # replace(), â€¢split(), and -join()
phrase = "banana"

#SEC PROB
# Prompt the user for their name and age
name = input("What is your name? ")
age = int(input("How old are you? "))

# Calculate the age next year
next_year_age = age + 1

# Use string methods to manipulate the string (example: capitalize name and split it)
name = name.capitalize()  # Capitalize the first letter of the name

# Create a sentence using string concatenation
sentence = "Hello, " + name + "! You are " + str(age) + " years old. Next year, you will be " + str(next_year_age) + " years old."

# Use .split() to turn the sentence into a list of words
sentence_words = sentence.split()

# Use .join() to join the list back with a space separator
formatted_sentence = " ".join(sentence_words)

# Print the sentence using custom separator and end
print(formatted_sentence, end=".\n")

# THRID PROB
# Prompt the user for a sentence
sentence = input("Enter a sentence: ")

# Prompt the user for a word to search for in the sentence
word = input("Enter a word to search for: ")

# Use .split() to break the sentence into a list of words
words = sentence.split()

# Check if the word is in the list of words
found = word in words

# Use .replace() to show a transformation in the sentence for fun (optional)
sentence_modified = sentence.replace(word, word.upper())

# Print the result using .join() to display the sentence with words joined by spaces
# Print whether the word was found (True/False)
print("Word found:", found, end=".\n")

# Print the modified sentence (showing the word in uppercase, if found)
print("Modified sentence:", sentence_modified, sep=" | ")

# fOURTH PROB
# Prompt the user for a word
word = input("Enter a word: ")

# Prompt the user for the first index
first_index = int(input("Enter the first index: "))

# Prompt the user for the last index
last_index = int(input("Enter the last index: "))

# Slice the word at the provided indexes
sliced_word = word[first_index:last_index]

# Use .replace() to show an example transformation (optional)
sliced_word_modified = sliced_word.replace("a", "A")

# Use .split() to split the sliced word into individual characters (as an example)
sliced_word_list = list(sliced_word)

# Use .join() to reassemble the sliced word with a custom separator (for demonstration)
reassembled_sliced_word = "|".join(sliced_word_list)

# Print the sliced word
print("Sliced word:", sliced_word, end=".\n")

# Print the modified sliced word (e.g., with 'a' replaced by 'A')
print("Modified sliced word:", sliced_word_modified, sep=" | ")

# Print the reassembled sliced word with "|" separator
print("Reassembled sliced word:", reassembled_sliced_word, sep=" | ")

#LAST FOR MOD 
word1 = input("Enter the first word: ")
word2 = input("Enter the second word: ")
word3 = input("Enter the third word: ")

# Use .split() to break the words into a list (though not strictly necessary here)
words = [word1, word2, word3]

# Optionally modify words using .replace() (for example, change lowercase 'a' to uppercase 'A')
modified_words = [word.replace("a", "A") for word in words]

# Use .join() to combine the words with a '|' separator
